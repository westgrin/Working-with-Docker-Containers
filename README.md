# Mini Project - Working with Docker Containers

## Project Overview
This project explores Docker containers, covering their creation with `docker run`, customization (e.g., environment variables, background mode), lifecycle management (start, stop, restart, remove), and a side hustle task, executed on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS with VS Code.

## Setup
- Initiated on Jul 04, 2025, 02:03 PM WAT.
- Used Ubuntu terminal (WSL) with VS Code, documented in /mnt/c/Users/User/Documents/Workspace/Shell_AWS_Mini_Project.

## Execution Steps
1. **Run Containers**:
   - Ran Ubuntu container with `docker run`, added environment variable (`-e`), and ran in background (`-d`).
   
2. **Manage Lifecycle**:
   - Started, stopped, restarted, and removed containers using `start`, `stop`, `restart`, and `rm`.
   
3. **Side Hustle Task**:
   - Started Ubuntu container, ran `uname -a`, stopped, restarted, and removed it.
   
   

## Learning Summary
This project enhanced my understanding of Docker containers as lightweight, portable units that encapsulate applications and dependencies, ensuring consistency across environments. I mastered the `docker run` command, customizing containers with options like `-e` for environment variables and `-d` for background execution, and managed their lifecycle with `start`, `stop`, `restart`, and `rm`. The side hustle task, involving running `uname -a`, stopping, restarting, and removing a container, reinforced these skills, highlighting the importance of lifecycle management for efficient deployment. This hands-on experience solidified Dockerâ€™s role in scalable, reproducible application runtime management.

## Tools Used
- **Ubuntu Terminal (WSL)**: For Docker commands and instance management.
- **VS Code**: For editing `README.md`.
- **Git Bash**: For version control and GitHub push.
- **AWS EC2**: For hosting the Ubuntu instance.

## Project Deliverables
- **Documentation**: This `README.md` with steps and learning summary.
